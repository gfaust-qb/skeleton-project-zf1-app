## public/
If the package provides a root-level directory for web server files, it MUST be named public/.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the directory.

N.b.: This directory MAY be intended as a web server document root. Alternatively, it MAY be that the files will be served dynamically via other code, copied or symlinked to the "real" document root, or otherwise managed so that they become publicly available on the web.
